## The problem

Most AI tools in medicine return a diagnosis. Second Opinion returns the *reasoning process behind it*.

Clinical reasoning is the hardest skill to teach. A diagnosis without explanation is useless to a student and indefensible to a clinician. When an experienced physician evaluates a patient, they don't jump to a conclusion: they build a list of possibilities, weigh the evidence, revise their thinking in real time, and ask the right questions. That process has never been made visible. Until now.

## What it does

Second Opinion takes a free-text patient presentation and streams a live, structured differential diagnosis: not as a chat response, but as a typed reasoning trace with auditable steps.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Live differential** | Top-3 hypotheses with animated probability bars, updated in real time as the model reasons |
| **Evidence** | Supporting and refuting clinical findings surfaced per hypothesis |
| **Clinical summary** | 2-3 sentence conclusion: leading diagnosis justified by specific clinical findings, then next steps and urgency |
| **Clarifying questions** | 2-3 targeted questions that would most narrow the differential |
| **Refinement** | Answer the questions or add new findings — each pass shown as a labeled block in the input card, differential reruns with updated context |
| **Comparison** | Run two models on the same case simultaneously, side by side; each pane saves to history independently |
| **PDF export** | Clinical-quality report: leading diagnosis with probability, differential with evidence, refinement passes, full reasoning log, disclaimer footer on every page |
| **Session history** | Last 10 runs saved locally — including compare runs — restorable in one click, deletable per entry |
| **Dark mode** | Full dark/light theme with OS preference detection |
| **Multilingual** | Complete Simplified Chinese interface, including all model output |

Every step is visible as it happens. The model cannot output a bare answer; it must justify each decision, one structured event at a time.

## Architecture

### Structured output over SSE

The system prompt instructs the model to respond exclusively in **NDJSON**: one typed JSON object per line, nothing else. Seven event types are defined: `thought`, `hypothesis`, `update`, `evidence`, `tests`, `conclusion`, and `question`. The server streams these to the client over **Server-Sent Events**. The frontend parses each line the moment it arrives; the live differential updates, probability bars animate, and evidence tags attach — all in real time.

### Prompt engineering as a schema enforcer

The model is not asked to "think about" a diagnosis. It is given a strict output contract with required field names, sequencing rules, and cardinality constraints. Malformed lines are silently discarded server-side before reaching the client. This turns an open-ended language model into a structured reasoning engine.

### Model comparison

Two models stream in parallel via `Promise.all`, each building its own differential independently. When both complete, results sit side by side: same patient, same moment, different reasoning paths. Each pane has its own PDF export and saves to session history.

### Iterative refinement

After the conclusion, the user can answer the model's clarifying questions or add new clinical detail. The original presentation stays unchanged in the textarea; each refinement pass appears below it as a labeled block with an accent border. The full context (original + all passes) is sent to the model for a new reasoning run.

### PDF export

`/api/pdf` receives the rendered report HTML, spins up a headless Chromium instance via Puppeteer, and calls `page.pdf()`. The report includes the leading diagnosis with probability and confidence, the top-3 differential with evidence, any refinement passes, and the full reasoning log. A disclaimer footer is pinned to the bottom of every page. Text is fully selectable.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- An [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai) API key

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/daniyeel/second-opinion.git
cd second-opinion
npm install
```

### Configuration

```bash
echo "OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_key_here" > .env
```

### Run

```bash
npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Tech stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Runtime | Node.js |
| Server | Express |
| Streaming | Server-Sent Events (SSE) |
| AI gateway | OpenRouter |
| PDF rendering | Puppeteer (headless Chromium) |
| Frontend | Vanilla JS (no framework, no build step) |
| Hosting | Railway |

## Models

| Model | ID |
|---|---|
| MiniMax M2 | `minimax/minimax-m2` |
| Gemini 2.0 Flash | `google/gemini-2.0-flash-001` |
| GPT-4o Mini | `openai/gpt-4o-mini` |
| GPT-4o | `openai/gpt-4o` |
| Claude Sonnet 4.6 | `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6` |

All models are routed through OpenRouter. MiniMax M2 is the default. Any model on OpenRouter can be swapped in with a one-line change in `server.js`.
